**1.1 Qserver**

The Qserver in this setup uses Quantum computing to Decrypt the token which is encrypted by classical RSA encryption algorithm by factorizing the public key value. The token in this case is a small number used for simplicity as factorizing large numbers would take a long time since I only have access to Shor being run on a simulator on a classical machine. This onviously isn't the case for a quantum machine.

(key, value) pairs can be stored using qubit registeres
for example: for a 4 qubit system, 2 qubit registeres (2^2) can be used to store 4 keys and 2 registers to store 4 values.

**3.2 Grover's Algorithm**

The Grover's Search algorithm is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database with N entries in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time. Classically, it would take O(N) time where we would need to search all entries in order to find the desired one. While this is only a quadratic speedup, it is quite significant when $N$ is large.

Given an unsorted list of $N$ elements, Grover's algorithm allows us to find a target element (in our case, a state) with $O(\sqrt N)$ operations or iterations. The reason why Grover's algorithm works so well (at least in theory) is because of its amplitude amplification, meaning it will single out the desired element without us having to search all the elements of the list.

Assumption: 1. That the Oracle has access to the elements(token values) of the classical list. 
2.That we can load with a superposition of addresses (token addresses) data from a RAM, also called QRAM. 

**Loading the values**

"<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?|x\rangle_{\text{address}}|0\rangle_{\text{value}}&space;\rightarrow&space;|x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm{load}(x)\oplus&space;0\rangle_{\text{value}}&space;=&space;|x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm{load}(x)\rangle_{\text{value}}." title="|x\rangle_{\text{address}}|0\rangle_{\text{value}} \rightarrow |x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm{load}(x)\oplus 0\rangle_{\text{value}} = |x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm{load}(x)\rangle_{\text{value}}." />/>

And then
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H^{\otimes&space;n}_{\text{address}}&space;|0\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm0\rangle_{\text{value}}=\frac1{2^{n/2}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}&space;|x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm0\rangle_{\text{value}}" title="H^{\otimes n}_{\text{address}} |0\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm0\rangle_{\text{value}}=\frac1{2^{n/2}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} |x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm0\rangle_{\text{value}}" />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{apply&space;load}\rightarrow\frac1{2^{n/2}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}&space;|x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm{load}(x)\rangle_{\text{value}}/" title="\text{apply load}\rightarrow\frac1{2^{n/2}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} |x\rangle_{\text{address}}|\textrm{load}(x)\rangle_{\text{value}}/" />

Firts apply the _Hadamard gates_ on the address register and then apply the _load operation_ on both registers. Then you will have a superposition of all values in the database an the value register.

Next, apply GA on the value register with any oracle (think of it as an optimization function and what constraints it has; like looking a for a prime or a specific value). After ùëÇ(‚àöùëÅ) iterations the correct answer will be measured with high probability. Thus, the correct solution together with the register address ùë•‚àó of the correct solution will be very likely measured.


**Steps for Grover's**

Step 1: The amplitude amplification procedure starts out in the uniform superposition  
|s‚ü© , which is easily constructed from 

Step 2: We apply the oracle reflection  Uf to the state|s‚ü©.

Step 3: We now apply an additional reflection (Us) about the state U_s = 2|s\rangle\langle s| - \mathbb{1} This transformation maps the state to  UsUf|s‚ü©and completes the transformation.
After t steps we will be in the state|œàt‚ü©where: |œàt‚ü©=(UsUf)t|s‚ü©.
 
How many times do we need to apply the rotation? It turns out that roughly ‚àöN rotations suffice.

It is better to think of the quantum search algorithm as optimizing a function, instead of searching in a list/database. In an after thought, Grover's might not be the best algorithm for searching. 


These are described by the following unitary evolution,

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U_f&space;\left|x&space;,&space;\bar&space;0&space;\right\rangle&space;=&space;\left|x,&space;f(x)\right\rangle." title="U_f&space;\left|x&space;,&space;\bar&space;0&space;\right\rangle&space;=&space;\left|x,&space;f(x)\right\rangle." />

Here <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left|x&space;,&space;\bar&space;0&space;\right\rangle&space;=&space;\left|x&space;\right\rangle&space;\otimes&space;\left|\bar&space;0&space;\right\rangle" title="\left|x , \bar 0 \right\rangle = \left|x \right\rangle \otimes \left|\bar 0 \right\rangle" />
 is used to represent a multi-qubit state consisting of two registers. The first register is in state  
|x‚ü©, where  x is  is a binary representation of the input to our function. The number of qubits in this register is the number of bits required to represent the inputs.

**3.3 Shor's Algorithm** 


Note: this implementation of Shor‚Äôs algorithm uses 4ùëõ+2 qubits, where ùëõ is the number of bits representing the integer in binary. So in practice, for now, this implementation is restricted to factorizing small integers. Given the above value of N we compute 4ùëõ+2 below and confirm the size from the actual circuit.
